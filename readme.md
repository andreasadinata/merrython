##Introduction
The name of Merrython is coming from "Merry" and "Marathon". The app will not only show a marathon event.
It just happens that the marathon event dominates most of the active call, so I decidede that marathon can be part of the title here.
The app's main purpose is to help user find a good outdoor activities around his/her area.
The drop comment function will be very useful in helping people to build up his/her community.
By giving the people chance to talk to one another through short comment on the page.

##Use Case
Why is this app useful? Some people are looking for friends to get active on the weekend.
If I can find a friend that can exercise together, the exercise will be so much easier.
The app's will not only limited to those people who does not really have any energize friends.
This app will help groups of people to find many outdoor activities. There are no limitation in it.

##Live Site
You can access the demo here https://merrython.herokuapp.com/

##Technical
* The app is built by HTML5, JS, CSS, JQuery, and node.
* Active API is the main source of the data
* The app is responsive where it can be easily accessed by mobile phone, tablet, and computer.
* The database of the user's comment will be store with mongoDB.
* Database will be stored in mLab.
* We are using Travis CI to be the main platform in testing out the program.

##Road Map
The app will have the data authentication in the future.
The earliest thing that might be can be developed is the short comment will be based on the user's area.
So it will be easier for people to really find a community.
The next thing is the login system which can help to sort group of people based on their location or search history.
The app will be the mix of yelp and meetup.com but in outdoor activities field.
